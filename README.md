# Traveling-Salesman-Optimization
Project aimed at solving the famously NP-hard problem of the Traveling Salesman (TSP).

In this project several algorithms are tried and compared:
1. Greedy Heuristics:
  - Nearest Neighbour 
  - Techniques for Nearest Neighbour
  - Extra Mileage (and with different conditions)
  - 2-OPT as refinement heuristic
2. Metaheuristics Algorithms:
  - Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)
  - Simulated annealing
  - Tabu Search
  - Genetic Algorithm
3. Exact Algorithms using IBM CPLEX LP solver:
  - Benders loop
  - Branch and Cut using Callbacks
4. Matheuristic Algorithms:
- Hard Fixing
- Local branching

**The whole project was presented at UniPD. For a comprehensive presentation, comparisons and graphs, see the PDF file**
